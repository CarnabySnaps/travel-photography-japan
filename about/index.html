Nonetheless documenting my trip by use of a camera struck a cord with me then and I’ve always taken one with me ever since. After using a variety of point &amp; shoot’s I invested in a <a title="Micro Four Thirds System" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Four_Thirds_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Micro Four Thirds</a> camera, an <a title="Olympus PEN Camera" href="http://www.olympus.co.uk/site/en/c/cameras/pen_cameras/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Olympus PEN</a> I brought second hand whilst on a trip in Japan (Needed something semi decent for that place!) which has  been by weapon of choice since, add in a couple of lens additions ~ a <a title="Pancake?" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_lens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pancake</a> and an extra zoom, and that’s what the majority of photos taken on this website have been taken with. (Note: I’ve since upgraded to a <a title="PEN EPL-5 " href="http://www.olympus.co.uk/site/en/c/cameras/pen_cameras/pen_lite/e_pl5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PEN EPL-5</a> and later to the epic <a title="OM-D E-M1" href="http://www.olympus.co.uk/site/en/c/cameras/om_d_system_cameras/om_d/e_m1/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OM-D E-M1</a> plus a new edition to my lenses, the excellent <a title="12-40mm Olympus Pro zoom" href="http://www.dpreview.com/articles/7260303249/olympus-introduces-12-40mm-f2-8-pro-zoom-for-micro-four-thirds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12-40mm Olympus Pro zoom</a>)</p><p>When it comes to ‘what kinda shooting do you do? portraits, landscapes, wildlife, street etc.’ well I’m a bit of an all-rounder, if I see something interesting and I like it, I’ll try and snap it. Travel photography is a biggie for me, love visiting new places and checking out unusual buildings &amp; structures, it’s one thing to see a place on the gogglebox (think travel documentaries, <a title="Micheal Palin" href="http://www.palinstravels.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Micheal Palin</a> &amp; <a title="Charley Boorman" href="http://www.charleyboorman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charley Boorman</a> being my most favourites)  but to actually stand in front of a great building and admire it in the flesh so to speak, well that really is something else. I thoroughly enjoy the whole travelling experience, arriving at the airport and being able to board a silver capsule to whisk you off to a foreign land is pretty magical to me.</p><p>Living near one of Britain’s most beautiful open spaces, <a title="Richmond Park" href="http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/richmond-park" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richmond Park</a>, affords me the luxury of snappin’ the local wildlife, foliage &amp; sunsets of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">which your find a dedicated section on this site</span><em> (strikethrough's - these were on my old website but not on here for the moment due to web space!)</em>, and also a different kind of wildlife altogether, <a title="London, England" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">London</a> Town, of which there’s plenty of things to snap day &amp; night in the urban jungle, again <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a special section dedicated to that too</span>.</p><p>Lastly <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">your find a selection</span> of photos from events I’ve been to in and around my home country of England, when time and money permit of course, overall I hope you enjoy the photos and the work that goes into them getting them presentable (Post-processing ~ the bain of every photographer) and if your interested to know more, even purchase a print for online use or have a canvas made (I have one of my own here, they look rather good hanging from the wall) please don’t hesitate to get in touch!</p><div class="standfirst"><em><strong>Mark</strong></em>.</div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2026 Carnaby Snaps.
